# Buddy

## Motivation
A team isn't just a group of individuals. A performing team should have a unified way of doing things and have healthy communication - written or verbal - between the team members to establish its conventions.

The buddy concept has six main goals:
1. Connect the team by pairing individuals.
2. Eliminate knowledge silos by sharing the knowledge across the team.
3. Improve planning and review skills by evaluating others' design and code.
4. Increase code quality by pairing with others.
5. Improve communication skills around design decisions.
6. Reduce managers' involvement in all software development phases.

## Buddy assignment
There's a [Trello](https://trello.com/b/9Z4PRP4R) board for managing buddies.
If you need a buddy, go to the 'free' buddies list and assign yourself a buddy. If there's no free buddy or any other reason that prevents you from choosing a buddy for yourself, ask your manager for help.

## Touchpoints
It's really up to you and your buddy to decide how often you should engage with each other. But there are several touchpoints which are essential to follow:
1. Breakdown review.
2. Design review.
3. Pull requests review.
