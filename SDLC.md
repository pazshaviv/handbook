## Folloze development project lifecycle
### Motivation
Weâ€™re working in a rapidly changing environment, with many requests for product innovation and adaptations.
As professionals we are expected to give accurate time estimations, provide the product team with the ability to make smart decisions that result in a great user experience under the time constraints.

Our SDLC goals are to:
1. Work less on developers task reassignment
2. Make our quarterly product plan less sensitive to minor delays in project releases
3. Involve QA and product earlier in the process
4. Support a backlog of tasks to respond to customer requests
5. Handle the growing backlog of support tasks

### SDLC definitions
Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATpJBeuknaQ) (until 16:30) to understand where we were inspired from
1. We work in a 2 weeks cycle with the following roles
    - ***Cycle Owner*** - Keeping the team from context switches. Handles all the unexpected issues, manages standups and looking at all the system errors - [read more](https://github.com/zvikamenahemi/handbook/blob/main/cycle-owner.md)
    - ***Backlog Owner*** - performs minor/small tasks/bugs of up to 6 development days. This backlog is updated by the product team before each cycle.  
    \* Sundays helping the cycle owner to clear the unexpected list
2. Medium/Large projects will always be split into two periods
   - **Release period** - 
     - 75% of the project
     - The period ends with a release to production*
     \* there might be multiple releases during the period
     - During the period the developer has two ways to make sure the feature is release on time
       1. ***Variable Scope*** - at the beginning of the project the developer is required to break the feature into tasks and provide time estimations for each task. This breakdown will be reviewed together with the product manager and the scope of the release will be adjusted accordingly by priorities.
       2. ***Technical Debt*** - decide together with the manager to mark some things as technical debt that will be addressed in the post release phase. It can be issues identified in the code reviews that will require too much time to fix or design choices that fit better the time available for the project.
   - **Post Release period**
     - 25% of the project
     - At the beginning of the phase technical debt is prioritized
     - This phase is all about cleaning after ourselves (fixing technical debt) and handling unexpected bugs

     - Reviewthe test plan
     - Make sure all requirements and use cases are covered
     - Make sure expected behaviour is clear
     - Map gaps in the test plan needed to be fixeed
5. **Weekly Status**
   - *Owners* - PM and developer 
   - *Participants* - PM, developer, UX, QA and tech manager (optional)

      - Feature is ready to be tested 
7. **Release** :dancer:
8. **Post Release**
   - *Owner* - PM
